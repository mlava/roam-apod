The images available from NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) service can be absolutely extraordinary.

**New:**
- fix for when APOD shows a video rather than an image
- Now compatible with the new user-defined hotkeys function - see Hotkeys option in Roam Research Settings

This extension allows you to import the APOD into your graph. You can trigger the extension by:
1. opening Command Palette and choosing Import the Astronomy Picture of the Day (NASA)
2. using the SmartBlock command <%APOD%>

The extension will output a header with the title of the image and the copyright holder. Three child blocks will contain the image, the description and a link to the HD Image on NASA's website.

You need a free API key from NASA available at: https://api.nasa.gov/#signUp
